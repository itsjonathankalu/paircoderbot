A simple, but extensible Node.js implementation for a Telegram Bot that uses the Groq API to generate intelligent responses.

## Features

- **Telegram Integration**: Connects to the Telegram Bot API using webhooks.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses the Groq API to generate responses with the `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model.
- **Easy to Set Up**: Get your bot running in a few simple steps.
- **Extensible**: The code is simple and can be easily extended with more features.

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running your own instance of this Telegram bot.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Telegram Bot Token**: You need to get a bot token from the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
- **Groq API Key**: You need an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- **Public URL**: You need a publicly accessible URL for Telegram to send updates to. For local development, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsjonathankalu/paircoderbot.git
    cd paircoderbot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the project root, create a file named `.env`. You can copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your credentials:
    ```
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with the actual tokens you obtained.

### Running Locally

For development and testing, you can run the bot on your local machine. Since Telegram webhooks require a public URL, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.

1.  **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    The server will start on port 3000.

2.  **Expose your local server with ngrok:**
    In a new terminal window, run:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    ngrok will give you a public URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok.io`).

3.  **Set up the webhook:**
    Use the public URL from ngrok to tell Telegram where to send messages.

    ```bash
    curl -F "url=https://<YOUR_NGROK_URL>/new-message" https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_NGROK_URL>` with the URL from ngrok and `<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>` with your bot's token.

    Now, any messages sent to your bot will be forwarded to your local server.

## Deployment

For your bot to work 24/7 without needing your computer to be on, you need to deploy it to a hosting service. This will give you a stable, public URL. We'll use [Railway](https://railway.app/) as an example.

### Why Deploy?

- **Always On**: Your bot will be online even when your computer is off.
- **Stable URL**: You get a permanent public URL for your webhook.
- **Scalability**: Hosting services can handle more traffic than your local machine.

### Deploying to Railway

1.  **Sign up for Railway**: Create an account on [railway.app](https://railway.app/). You can sign up with your GitHub account.

2.  **Create a New Project**:

    - Go to your Railway dashboard and click "New Project".
    - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo".
    - Choose the repository for this bot.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:

    - In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab.
    - Add the same environment variables as in your `.env` file:
      - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
      - `GROQ_API_KEY`
    - Railway will automatically use these variables when it runs your application.

4.  **Deploy**:
    Railway will automatically detect that it's a Node.js project and deploy it. It will use the `start` script in your `package.json`. If you don't have a `start` script, make sure to add one:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js"
    }
    ```

5.  **Get Your Public URL**:
    Once deployed, Railway will provide you with a public URL for your service (e.g., `my-telegram-bot.up.railway.app`).

### Set the Webhook for Production

Now that you have your public URL from Railway, you need to tell Telegram to use it for your bot's webhook.

You will use the `curl` command, just like for local development, but with your production URL.

```bash
curl -F "url=https://<YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL>/new-message" https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
```

Replace `<YOUR_RAILWAY_APP_URL>` with the URL you got from Railway and `<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>` with your bot's token.

Once you run this command, your bot is live and will respond to messages using your deployed server on Railway.

## Usage

Once the bot is running and the webhook is set, you can open Telegram and start a conversation with your bot. Any message you send will be processed by the Groq API, and you will receive an AI-generated response.

### Beyond the Chatbot

This repository provides a solid foundation for various types of Telegram bots, not just chatbots. By modifying the logic in the `/new-message` route in `index.js`, you can create a wide range of applications. Here are a few ideas:

- **Content Delivery Bot**: Create a bot that sends daily news, weather updates, or motivational quotes.
- **To-Do List Bot**: Build a personal assistant that helps you manage your tasks.
- **Language Translator**: Use a translation API to create a bot that translates messages between different languages.
- **Image Search Bot**: Integrate with an image API (like Freepik, Unsplash, or Pexels) to build a bot that can find and send images based on user queries.
- **Integration Bot**: Connect to other services like Google Calendar, Trello, or GitHub to create a bot that sends notifications or manages tasks.
- **Quiz or Poll Bot**: Create a bot that can conduct quizzes or polls in a group chat.

The basic setup for receiving messages and sending replies is already in place. You just need to change what happens when a message is received.

## Model and Rate Limits

This bot uses the `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model from Groq. The free tier of the Groq API has the following rate limits for this model:

- **30 requests/minute**
- **~14,400 requests/day**
- **6K tokens/minute**
- **500K tokens/day**

If the bot doesn't respond, it's likely that the daily limit has been reached. In this case, please try again later.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application. It contains the Express server, the webhook handler, and the logic for interacting with the Telegram and Groq APIs.
- `package.json`: Defines the project's metadata and lists the dependencies.
- `.env`: Stores the API keys and other secret credentials. This file is not committed to version control.
- `.env.example`: An example file for the environment variables.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following main dependencies:

- [express](https://expressjs.com/): A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/): A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- [groq-sdk](https://github.com/groq/groq-node): The official Node.js SDK for the Groq API.
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv): A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
